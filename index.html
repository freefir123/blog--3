    <p class="text-muted text -left"> Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible. </p>

    The results of a new study that looked to determine the best superhero movie of all time have been revealed. Using a number of different pieces of data, such as box office performance and critical approval, it has been determined that 2019's Avengers: Endgame is the world's favorite superhero movie of all time. Joker, also released in 2019, took the number two spot.

Researchers analyzed 100 superhero movies to make the determinations. The factors they looked at include the IMDB audience rating, the critical rating from Metacritic, worldwide box office (adjusted for inflation) and annual search volume. Taking that all into account, director Joe and Anthony Russo's Avengers: Endgame took the top spot. Using all of the data, the overall score assigned was 78.67. For comparison's sake, coming in at number 100 was The Toxic Avenger, which scored 33.24 overall.

  Saw it today and they loved it.You should have a minimal previous understanding of the movies or you’ll miss 40% of the fun.At minimum:Infinity WarCivil WarBlack PantherAge ofAnt Man and the WaspProblem is that the whole movie is homage to all movies. Yet you will enjoy it a lot.There is at the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. But most is comic book style figand battles.Must go to bathroom just before the movie because ut does last 3 hours all worthwhile.

"A decade in the making, this book is based on hundreds of hours of in-depth interviews with each of the twenty-four moon voyagers, as well as those who contributed their brain power, training and teamwork on Earth."[1]
This book formed the basis of the 1998 television miniseries From the Earth to the Moon. It was released in paperback in 2007 by Penguin Books, ISBN 978-0-14-311235-8.
